# Csharp-NJPO2

modern object-oriented programming languages 2

Here is some C# code that I needed to prepare during my IT studies at Univeristy of Silesia.
Below description to every exercise.
Every exercise is being separated with 169 long spam of "/"

*1 - I needed to code an abstract class which would calculate field and perimeter of any given triangle. It was also required to code an inherited classes to every type of triangle (equilateral, equilibrium, rectangular).

*2 - exercise was mostly about creating a generic class "worker's files" in which there would be possible to add/delete, show, search or just validate data.

*3 - here is some funny code that changes any given expression into Reverse Polish Notation.

*4 - some basic code that compares a sum of two lists and gives back true/false.

*5 - in that exercise I needed to code two Classes Student and Degree, link them, and made it possible to to search for some Students (showing only students, whose age is higher then average of students on that year).

*6 - implementation of three choosen design patterns (each one of them is separateted with some spam of "// // //")

*7 - implementation of class SortedList using strategy design pattern.

*8 - implementation of class observer for collection of my choose (in a moment of any changes I needed to pop up information about that in a console)
